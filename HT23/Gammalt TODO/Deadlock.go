	fmt.Println(<-ch)

	// A goroutine can get stuck
	// either because itâ€™s waiting for a channel or
	// because it is waiting for one of the locks in the sync package.

	// Common reasons are that
	// no other goroutine has access to the channel or the lock
	// a group of goroutines are waiting for each other and none of them is able to proceed.
